This is a fork of [pseudoku's Chicago Stenographer](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles) keycaps for the Cherry ULP Switches.
The regular files are known to produce printing errors!
The files in the downshift0.5mm folders should prevent these issues but are currently untested.
Big thanks to [microfortnight](https://github.com/microfortnight/) for help with the generation of the STLs.
